<Center><Font size=+2><B>Footnotes</B></Font></Center><BR>


<A Name="1"></A><B>[1]</B> The phrase "and he will exist so" means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="2"></A><B>[2]</B> The phrase "and he will exist so" means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="3"></A><B>[3]</B> The phrase "and he will exist so" means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="4"></A><B>[4]</B> Days one through three are the "separating" of the skies and land. On the first day the light is separated from the darkness. On the second day the water is separated from the skies. On the third day, the water is separated from the land.<BR><BR>
<A Name="5"></A><B>[5]</B> The phrase "and he will exist so" means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="6"></A><B>[6]</B> The phrase "and the stars" is grammatically and contextually out of place and appears to have been added to the text. In addition, the Dead Sea Scroll of Genesis does not include this phrase.<BR><BR>
<A Name="7"></A><B>[7]</B> This Hebrew word is translated in various ways including; whale, sea-monster, dragon, serpent, asp and jackal (see Exodus 7:9, Deuteronomy 32:33, Nehemiah 2:13, Job 7:12). According to these texts this is a very large creature and lives on the land and in the water, which are characteristics of the crocodile.<BR><BR>
<A Name="8"></A><B>[8]</B> The Hebrew literally reads "his living ones," but may be written defectively.<BR><BR>
<A Name="9"></A><B>[9]</B> The phrase "and he existed so" Hebraicly means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="10"></A><B>[10]</B> The phrase "and he will exist so" Hebraicly means "and it is firmly established."<BR><BR>
<A Name="11"></A><B>[11]</B> Days four through six are the "filling" of the skies and land and are paralleled with the first three days (see the footnote at Genesis 1:13). On the fourth day the light is filled with the sun and the night with the moon. On the fifth day the water is filled with fish and the skies with birds. On the sixth day the land is filled with animals and man.<BR><BR>
<A Name="12"></A><B>[12]</B> The singular word "tree" may imply a "tree" or "trees." the context of this and following verses do not specify if there is one tree or a forest of trees. Compare this with 2:16.<BR><BR>
<A Name="13"></A><B>[13]</B> The helper will have the character traits that are complimentary to his own.<BR><BR>
<A Name="14"></A><B>[14]</B> See verse 18.<BR><BR>
<A Name="15"></A><B>[15]</B> The Hebrew phrase &#1497;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1488; &#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492; literally translates as "he will be called out woman." Either the "he" is an error and should be "she," or the text originally read &#1497;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468; &#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;, which would then be translated as "he called out her title woman." <BR><BR>
<A Name="16"></A><B>[16]</B> In the Leningrad codex this word is written as &#1500;&#1467;&#1511;&#1459;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492; (lu'qo'hhah).<BR><BR>
<A Name="17"></A><B>[17]</B> The Phrase "MOREOVER GIVEN.THAT" means "really."<BR><BR>
<A Name="18"></A><B>[18]</B> This word can also means "sound" (see also verse 10).<BR><BR>
<A Name="19"></A><B>[19]</B> "Spitted upon" is an idiom for "cursed."<BR><BR>
<A Name="20"></A><B>[20]</B> The Hebrew word &#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (a head) could also be translated as "first."<BR><BR>
<A Name="21"></A><B>[21]</B> The Hebrew word &#1506;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1489; (a heel) could also be translated as "last."<BR><BR>
<A Name="22"></A><B>[22]</B> Hebrew masculine plural nouns may refer to only males or a group of males and females. Therefore, the word "sons" may also be translated as "children." <BR><BR>
<A Name="23"></A><B>[23]</B> The Hebrew verb &#1513;&#1502;&#1506; (sh'ma) means to hear and respond.<BR><BR>
<A Name="24"></A><B>[24]</B> "Spitted upon" is an idiom for "cursed."<BR><BR>
<A Name="25"></A><B>[25]</B> The tense of this verb is in the perfect tense (completed action) implying she has given birth to children. Another possible explanation is that the Hebrew verb is written defectively and was originally in the imperfect tense (incomplete action).<BR><BR>
<A Name="26"></A><B>[26]</B> The Hebrew phrase &#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491; &#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; can be translated as "like one of us" (referring to the Elohiym, a plural word) or "like one of him" (referring to the serpent). Compare with the words of the serpent in verse 5.<BR><BR>
<A Name="27"></A><B>[27]</B> If the Hebrew word &#1488;&#1462;&#1514; (AT) is being used as a preposition (with), then the translation provided is correct. However, if it is being used as the marker of the definite object, then the translation should be "I purchased the man YHWH."<BR><BR>
<A Name="28"></A><B>[28]</B> This word is usually followed by a number of years or days to identify the end of that time frame, such as in Genesis 8:6 where it states "at the conclusion of the forty days." In this verse, it appears that the period of time is missing.<BR><BR>
<A Name="29"></A><B>[29]</B> "Flaring up" is an idiom for "anger."<BR><BR>
<A Name="30"></A><B>[30]</B> "Face fell" is an idiom for sadness."<BR><BR>
<A Name="31"></A><B>[31]</B> It is often assumed the pronoun "him" is referring to the "failure." However, the word "failure" is a feminine noun. One interpretation is that the pronoun "him" is referring to his brother. Compare the phrase "to you is his following and you will regulate in him" with the same phrasing in Genesis 3:16 where it is referring to the man and his woman.<BR><BR>
<A Name="32"></A><B>[32]</B> The conversation between Qayin and Hevel is missing from the text. The phrase "let us go out into the field" is found in the Greek Septuagint. The Septuagint may have been translated from a Hebrew text with the conversation intact or the translators may have supplied the phrase to clarify the text.<BR><BR>
<A Name="33"></A><B>[33]</B> "Spitted upon" is an idiom for "cursed."<BR><BR>
<A Name="34"></A><B>[34]</B> "Staggering and nodding" mean to wander aimlessly.<BR><BR>
<A Name="35"></A><B>[35]</B> The phrase &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492; &#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512; may  be translated as "he existed as a builder of a city" or "he existed, building a city."<BR><BR>
<A Name="36"></A><B>[36]</B> A father can be the father of a son, an ancestor, or the creator of a trade or profession.<BR><BR>
<A Name="37"></A><B>[37]</B> "Tent and livestock settlers" are nomads.<BR><BR>
<A Name="38"></A><B>[38]</B> "Seizing hold," in this context, means "players," who grab hold of an instrument.<BR><BR>
<A Name="39"></A><B>[39]</B> Or "instructor" in the sense of sharpening the skills of students.<BR><BR>
<A Name="40"></A><B>[40]</B> The phrase "to call out in the title" may also be translated as "to meet with the character."<BR><BR>
<A Name="41"></A><B>[41]</B> The Septuagint has 230 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="42"></A><B>[42]</B> The Septuagint has 205 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="43"></A><B>[43]</B> The Septuagint has 190 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="44"></A><B>[44]</B> The Septuagint has 170 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="45"></A><B>[45]</B> The Septuagint has 165 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="46"></A><B>[46]</B> The Septuagint has 165 years.<BR><BR>
<A Name="47"></A><B>[47]</B> "Spitted upon" is an idiom for a "curse."<BR><BR>
<A Name="48"></A><B>[48]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="49"></A><B>[49]</B> The Hebrew word &#1491;&#1493;&#1503; means to moderate, judge or rule over.<BR><BR>
<A Name="50"></A><B>[50]</B> The word &#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1501; can mean "from a distant time" (meaning ancient), but can also mean "from a distant place."<BR><BR>
<A Name="51"></A><B>[51]</B> "Men of the title" may be interpreted as "men of character."<BR><BR>
<A Name="52"></A><B>[52]</B> "Found beauty in the eyes of" is an idiom meaning "was accepted by."<BR><BR>
<A Name="53"></A><B>[53]</B> "To the face" means "in front" or "before."<BR><BR>
<A Name="54"></A><B>[54]</B> The grammar of the Hebrew text can be translated as "the land of violence was filled." the Hebrew appears to be missing the word &#1488;&#1462;&#1514; or the prefix &#1489; (both can be translated as "with") before the word violence. Compare this with Genesis 6: 13.<BR><BR>
<A Name="55"></A><B>[55]</B> The "road" of man is his customs, manner or actions.<BR><BR>
<A Name="56"></A><B>[56]</B> "To my face" is an idiom meaning "before me."<BR><BR>
<A Name="57"></A><B>[57]</B> "From their face" means "with their presence."<BR><BR>
<A Name="58"></A><B>[58]</B> The meaning of this word in this context is uncertain. It is usually translated as "window," but the window of the vessel, mentioned in Genesis 8:6, is a different Hebrew word.<BR><BR>
<A Name="59"></A><B>[59]</B> The meaning of the phrase "to a forearm you will finish her above" is uncertain.<BR><BR>
<A Name="60"></A><B>[60]</B> "To my face" is an idiom meaning "in front of me."<BR><BR>
<A Name="61"></A><B>[61]</B> In context, the "men and his women" are the" males and their mates" from the pure beasts.<BR><BR>
<A Name="62"></A><B>[62]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="63"></A><B>[63]</B> "Bone of this day" is an idiom of uncertain meaning, but may mean "this very same day" or the "middle of this day."<BR><BR>
<A Name="64"></A><B>[64]</B> "In unit" probably means "in the first day."<BR><BR>
<A Name="65"></A><B>[65]</B> In the sense of "anxiously awaiting."<BR><BR>
<A Name="66"></A><B>[66]</B> In the sense of "anxiously awaiting."<BR><BR>
<A Name="67"></A><B>[67]</B> "In unit" probably means "in the first day."<BR><BR>
<A Name="68"></A><B>[68]</B> Probably the first "new moon."<BR><BR>
<A Name="69"></A><B>[69]</B> Qere = &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="70"></A><B>[70]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="71"></A><B>[71]</B> The phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; should grammatically be translated as "in all which the ground will tread." It is probable that the Hebrew text is in error. <BR><BR>
<A Name="72"></A><B>[72]</B> This is assumed to be a "rainbow."<BR><BR>
<A Name="73"></A><B>[73]</B> In context, the word "scattered" means that the land was divided into sections (see Genesis 10:5).<BR><BR>
<A Name="74"></A><B>[74]</B> All modern translations have "his tent," but the Hebrew spelling of this word should be translated as "her tent." the Hebrew spelling may be in error but, in the modern Bedouin culture, which is very similar to the ancient Hebrew culture, the family tent is owned by the wife. Therefore, it is possible that the Hebrew text may use the word "her tent" in reference to this cultural context.<BR><BR>
<A Name="75"></A><B>[75]</B> The phrase "nakedness of the father" is an idiom for "sexual relations with the wife of the father" as seen in Leviticus 18:8. Also, the phrase "uncover the nakedness" is another idiom for "sexual relations." the common interpretation of this verse is that Hham saw his father naked; however this is not a wrongful act. the idiomatic phrasing of this verse means that Hham had sexual relations with his mother. This type of relationship is forbidden and is the reason why Kena'an, the product of this union, is cursed in verse Genesis 9:25.<BR><BR>
<A Name="76"></A><B>[76]</B> This Hebrew word can also mean "country."<BR><BR>
<A Name="77"></A><B>[77]</B> The word tongue means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="78"></A><B>[78]</B> The phrase "to the face of" is an idiom meaning "in front of."<BR><BR>
<A Name="79"></A><B>[79]</B> The construction of the sentence identifies Ashur (as a person) as the subject of the verb "go out" and would be translated as "Ashur went out." If however, the original meaning of the phrase was "he went out to Ashur," (where the "he" is Nimrod and Ashur is a place, see Genesis 2:14) the word "to" should have preceded the word Ashur.<BR><BR>
<A Name="80"></A><B>[80]</B> The word tongue means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="81"></A><B>[81]</B> That is, the Hebrews, which in the Hebrew language is &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (ivrim) meaning "ones of Ever."<BR><BR>
<A Name="82"></A><B>[82]</B> The word tongue means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="83"></A><B>[83]</B> The word for a "lip" can also mean a "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="84"></A><B>[84]</B> The word lip means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="85"></A><B>[85]</B> "Fenced in" in this context means limited or restricted.<BR><BR>
<A Name="86"></A><B>[86]</B> The word lip means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="87"></A><B>[87]</B> Possibly meaning "understand."<BR><BR>
<A Name="88"></A><B>[88]</B> The word lip means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="89"></A><B>[89]</B> The word lip means "language."<BR><BR>
<A Name="90"></A><B>[90]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="91"></A><B>[91]</B> "Upon the face of" is an idiom meaning "in the presence of."<BR><BR>
<A Name="92"></A><B>[92]</B> All modern translations have "his tent" but the Hebrew spelling of this word should be translated as "her tent." the Hebrew spelling may be in error but, in the modern Bedouin culture, which is very similar to the Ancient Hebrew culture, the family tent is owned by the wife. Therefore, it is possible that the Hebrew text may use the word "her tent" in reference to this cultural context. The phrase "he called out in the title" may also be translated as "he met with the title."<BR><BR>
<A Name="93"></A><B>[93]</B> This word can also mean "west," as the Mediterranean "sea" is "west" of Israel.<BR><BR>
<A Name="94"></A><B>[94]</B> The phrase "and he called out in the title of YHWH" can also be translated as "and he met with the character of YHWH."<BR><BR>
<A Name="95"></A><B>[95]</B> The word "to" appears to be missing before the word "House," otherwise this phrase should be translated as "and took the woman of the house of Paroh."<BR><BR>
<A Name="96"></A><B>[96]</B> This word can also mean "matter."<BR><BR>
<A Name="97"></A><B>[97]</B> Meaning "wealthy."<BR><BR>
<A Name="98"></A><B>[98]</B> Qere = &#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1500;&#1465;&#1493; (his tent). The ketiv, meaning "her tent," may be correct. In the modern Bedouin culture, which is very similar to the Ancient Hebrew culture, the family tent is owned by the wife. Therefore, it is possible that the Hebrew text may use the word "her tent" in reference to this cultural context.<BR><BR>
<A Name="99"></A><B>[99]</B> The phrase "he called out in the title of YHWH" can also be translated as "he met with the character of YHWH."<BR><BR>
<A Name="100"></A><B>[100]</B> Meaning "support."<BR><BR>
<A Name="101"></A><B>[101]</B> Meaning "well watered."<BR><BR>
<A Name="102"></A><B>[102]</B> Qere = &#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1493;&#1497;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="103"></A><B>[103]</B> Meaning "came together."<BR><BR>
<A Name="104"></A><B>[104]</B> Qere = &#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1493;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="105"></A><B>[105]</B> The word "narrow" may mean "difficult."<BR><BR>
<A Name="106"></A><B>[106]</B> The word "not," at the beginning of Abram's statement, according to the context, appears to be missing from the text.<BR><BR>
<A Name="107"></A><B>[107]</B> The Hebrew text has the names listed as "Dameseq Eliezer" which requires the translation "Dameseq of Eliezer" or as a compound name - "Dameseq-Eliezer." If the standard translation of "Eliezer of Damascus" is correct then the names must be reversed to "Eliezer Dameseq."<BR><BR>
<A Name="108"></A><B>[108]</B> The word threefold probably means "three years old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="109"></A><B>[109]</B> The Samaritan Pentateuch has the word &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512; (with the turtledove).<BR><BR>
<A Name="110"></A><B>[110]</B> The Phrase "UNTIL TO.THIS.POINT" means "ever again" or "yet."<BR><BR>
<A Name="111"></A><B>[111]</B> Meaning a "fountain."<BR><BR>
<A Name="112"></A><B>[112]</B> "Upon the faces of" means "in the presence of."<BR><BR>
<A Name="113"></A><B>[113]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="114"></A><B>[114]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="115"></A><B>[115]</B> "Son" is an idiom for days "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="116"></A><B>[116]</B> The perfect tense of the verb requires it to be translated as "I gave,"  but the context indicates that the verb tense should have been in the imperfect, which would then be translated as "I will give."<BR><BR>
<A Name="117"></A><B>[117]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="118"></A><B>[118]</B> "Daughter" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="119"></A><B>[119]</B> "To your face" is an idiom for "in your sight."<BR><BR>
<A Name="120"></A><B>[120]</B> "Bone of this day" is an idiom of uncertain meaning, but may mean "this very same day" or the "middle of this day."<BR><BR>
<A Name="121"></A><B>[121]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="122"></A><B>[122]</B> "Son" is an idiom for years "old."<BR><BR>
<A Name="123"></A><B>[123]</B> "Bone of this day" is an idiom of uncertain meaning, but may mean "this very same day" or the "middle of this day."<BR><BR>
<A Name="124"></A><B>[124]</B> The name "Adonai" may be translated as a name, "Adonai [my lords], or as the possessive plural noun "my lords." Context supports both translations as there are three men before Avraham allowing for the "my lords" translation but, the three uses of the pronoun "you" in the singular implies that he is speaking to one individual supporting the use of the word as a name.<BR><BR>
<A Name="125"></A><B>[125]</B> Meaning to "refresh."<BR><BR>
<A Name="126"></A><B>[126]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT UPON SO" means "since."<BR><BR>
<A Name="127"></A><B>[127]</B> Possibly an idiom for the season of "spring."<BR><BR>
<A Name="128"></A><B>[128]</B> The prefix "in," or other clarifying word, is missing from the word "opening."<BR><BR>
<A Name="129"></A><B>[129]</B> "Coming in the days" means "advanced in age."<BR><BR>
<A Name="130"></A><B>[130]</B> The phrase "the path like the women terminated "to exist" means "the time of childbearing has ended."<BR><BR>
<A Name="131"></A><B>[131]</B> In reference to being beyond childbearing age (see verse 11).<BR><BR>
<A Name="132"></A><B>[132]</B> The Phrase "MOREOVER INDEED" means "really."<BR><BR>
<A Name="133"></A><B>[133]</B> Or "thing."<BR><BR>
<A Name="134"></A><B>[134]</B> Possibly an idiom for the season of "spring."<BR><BR>
<A Name="135"></A><B>[135]</B> Meaning "hide."<BR><BR>
<A Name="136"></A><B>[136]</B> "To the face" is an idiom for "in front."<BR><BR>
<A Name="137"></A><B>[137]</B> Meaning "spare."<BR><BR>
<A Name="138"></A><B>[138]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="139"></A><B>[139]</B> The grammar of this verse implies that the men of Sedom were surrounded. As the context of the verse is the men of Sedom surrounding the house of Lot, it appears that the passage is written defectively.<BR><BR>
<A Name="140"></A><B>[140]</B> The phrase "and~the~DOOR he~did~SHUT" should read "and~at the~DOOR he~did~SHUT" (compare with 19:10).<BR><BR>
<A Name="141"></A><B>[141]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT UPON SO" means "since."<BR><BR>
<A Name="142"></A><B>[142]</B> The Hebrew of this verse appears to be missing some text. It appears this verse should read something like "and Avraham said to Sarah his woman [missing text, possibly, "say you are my brother"] [missing text, possibly, "and he said to Aviymelek the king of Gerar"] she is my sister and Aviymelekh the king of Gerar sent [missing text, possibly, "his servant"] and he took Sarah (See 20:5)<BR><BR>
<A Name="143"></A><B>[143]</B> Most translations have something like "and it was I who kept you from sinning against me" implying the sin of Aviymelekh. The Hebrew however implies it is the sin (fault) of Avraham.<BR><BR>
<A Name="144"></A><B>[144]</B> This word can also mean "matter."<BR><BR>
<A Name="145"></A><B>[145]</B> The Phrase "ALSO SURE" means "indeed."<BR><BR>
<A Name="146"></A><B>[146]</B> This word can also mean "matter."<BR><BR>
<A Name="147"></A><B>[147]</B> The phrase "UPON  CONCERNING~s" means "on account of."<BR><BR>
<A Name="148"></A><B>[148]</B> The Phrase "WHAT TO.THIS.POINT" means "what is this" or "what are these<BR><BR>

<A Name="151"></A><B>[151]</B> The Phrase "SINCE WHICH" means "because."<BR><BR>
<A Name="152"></A><B>[152]</B> The word "Gate" is missing the prefix "to."<BR><BR>

<A Name="155"></A><B>[155]</B> The phrase "the~RED" appears twice and is probably an accidental repeat by a scribe.<BR><BR>
<A Name="156"></A><B>[156]</B> An idiom meaning "apart from."<BR><BR>
<A Name="157"></A><B>[157]</B> The Phrase "SINCE WHICH" means "because."<BR><BR>
<A Name="158"></A><B>[158]</B> The phrase "and~they(m)~will~much~FILL~them(m) POWDER" is missing a preposition and should probably read "and~they(m)~will~much~FILL~them(m) WITH POWDER" or "and~they(m)~will~much~FILL~them(m) in~POWDER."<BR><BR>
<A Name="159"></A><B>[159]</B> The phrase "he called out in the title" may also be translated as "he met with the title."<BR><BR>
<A Name="160"></A><B>[160]</B> The phrase BETWEEN~s~us is written twice in the Hebrew. In one case the word between is written in the masculine plural and the other is in the feminine plural. It would appear that one of these was accidentally added to the text.<BR><BR>
<A Name="161"></A><B>[161]</B> The phrase "like~WHICH," meaning "just as," implies the phrase before is similar in meaning to the phrase after. If the phrase after the "like~WHICH" is positive then the phrase before must also be positive but, the phrase is negative. the probable solution is that the word "Not" is missing prior to the verb "you(ms)~will~DO."<BR><BR>
<A Name="162"></A><B>[162]</B> Qere = &#1510;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="163"></A><B>[163]</B> The sentence "and~he~will~GIVE to~you the~Elohiym from~DEW the~SKY~s2" may be translated as "and the Elohiym gave to you from the dew of the skies" or "and he gave to you the Elohiym from the dew of the skies."<BR><BR>
<A Name="164"></A><B>[164]</B> Qere = &#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="165"></A><B>[165]</B> The Phrase "WITHOUT THIS GIVEN.THAT IF" means "this is nothing except."<BR><BR>
<A Name="166"></A><B>[166]</B> The word Maid appears to be missing the prefix "to~" (see 29:29 for a comparison).<BR><BR>
<A Name="167"></A><B>[167]</B> The word "he~did~CALL.OUT" is probably an error for "she~did~CALL.OUT" as Le'ah called out the names of the other three children (see 29:32, 29:33 and 29:35).<BR><BR>
<A Name="168"></A><B>[168]</B> Qere = &#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488; &#1490;&#1464;&#1491; (fortune came).<BR><BR>
<A Name="169"></A><B>[169]</B> The Phrase "YESTERDAY THREE.DAYS.AGO" is an idiom meaning "previously."<BR><BR>
<A Name="170"></A><B>[170]</B> The phrase "the~FIELD TO FLOCKS~him" should be translated as "the field to his flocks" but may have originally been written as "TO the~FIELD FLOCKS~him" which would be translated as "to the field of his flock" which better fits the context of the sentence structure.<BR><BR>
<A Name="171"></A><B>[171]</B> The Phrase "YESTERDAY THREE.DAYS.AGO" is an idiom meaning "previously."<BR><BR>
<A Name="172"></A><B>[172]</B> The word "Upon" or "To" appears to be missing from the word "hill."<BR><BR>
<A Name="173"></A><B>[173]</B> This verse is the first verse of chapter 32 in Hebrew Bibles, but in English Bibles this verse is the last verse (55) of chapter 31. For the remainder of this chapter the verse numbers in English Bibles will be one number lower. For instance, verse 32:5 in the Hebrew Bible will be 32:4 in English Bibles.<BR><BR>
<A Name="174"></A><B>[174]</B> The verse appears to be missing the phrase "he~did~SAY" prior to "i~did~SEE."<BR><BR>
<A Name="175"></A><B>[175]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT UPON SO" means "since."<BR><BR>
<A Name="176"></A><B>[176]</B> The verse appears to be missing one or two prepositions. There are several possible translations for this verse depending on where the preposition or prepositions are placed. One possible translation is "and Ya'aqov came to Shalem, a city of Shekhem." Another possible translation is "and Ya'aqov came in completeness to the city of Shekhem" (the word Shalem would be a noun rather than a proper name). Another is "and Ya'aqov of Shalem came to the city of Shekhem" (nowhere does the text suggest that Ya'aqov is from Shalem which would invalidate this translation).<BR><BR>
<A Name="177"></A><B>[177]</B> The word "To," the prefix "to" or the suffix "unto" appears to be missing from the name "Beyt El."<BR><BR>
<A Name="178"></A><B>[178]</B> The word "To," the prefix "to" or the suffix "unto" appears to be missing from the name "Beyt El."<BR><BR>
<A Name="179"></A><B>[179]</B> All modern translations have "his tent" but the Hebrew spelling of this word should be translated as "her tent." the Hebrew spelling may be in error but, in the modern Bedouin culture, which is very similar to the Ancient Hebrew culture, the family tent is owned by the wife. Therefore, it is possible that the Hebrew text may use the word "her tent" in reference to this cultural context.<BR><BR>
<A Name="180"></A><B>[180]</B> The word "To," the prefix "to" or the suffix "unto" appears to be missing from the name "Mamre."<BR><BR>
<A Name="181"></A><B>[181]</B> The word "To," the prefix "to" or the suffix "unto" appears to be missing from the name "Qiryat Arbahh."<BR><BR>

<A Name="184"></A><B>[184]</B> The list of the sons of Tsiv'on begin with "and" unlike any other list of names. Either the "and" was accidentally added to the beginning of the list of names or there is supposed to be a name preceding this first "and."<BR><BR>
<A Name="185"></A><B>[185]</B> The Hebrew text identifies this name as Dishan but is probably written in error and should be Dishon. Compare the names of the sons of Dishan from Genesis 36:28 and 1 Chronicles 1:42 and the names of the sons of Dishon from Genesis 36:26 and 1 Chronicles 1:41 (although, in the Genesis account the first son is Hhemdan but in the Chronicles account it is Amram. In the middle (paleo) Hebrew script the letters used to write each of these names are similar in appearance and are easy to juxtapose.)<BR><BR>
<A Name="186"></A><B>[186]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="187"></A><B>[187]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="188"></A><B>[188]</B> The phrase "Not we~will~make~HIT~him BEING" would literally be translated as "we will not hit him, a being" and makes no grammatical sense. the phrase may have originally been written as "Not we~will~make~HIT BEING~him" meaning "we will not hit his being."<BR><BR>
<A Name="189"></A><B>[189]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="190"></A><B>[190]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT UPON SO" means "since."<BR><BR>
<A Name="191"></A><B>[191]</B> The Phrase "ADD YET.AGAIN" means "continue."<BR><BR>
<A Name="192"></A><B>[192]</B> The Hebrew word for "lord" is written in the plural, possibly in reference to the great power (often emphasized by plurality) that Potiphar holds. This is also found in verses 3, 7, 8, 19 and 20.<BR><BR>
<A Name="193"></A><B>[193]</B> The phrase "day day" means "day by day" or "daily."<BR><BR>
<A Name="194"></A><B>[194]</B> Qere = &#1488;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="195"></A><B>[195]</B> The Hebrew word for "lord" is written in the plural, possibly in reference to the great power (often emphasized by plurality) that the King holds. Also in verse 7.<BR><BR>
<A Name="196"></A><B>[196]</B> The context of the story implies that Yoseph was placed in charge over the drinker and the baker. The structure of the sentence as written should be translated as "and the noble of the slaughterers visited Yoseph with them." the verb "visit" is written in the text as simple-active (Visit) but should be in the causative-active (make~VISIT) which would then be translated as "and the noble of the slaughterers set Yoseph over them."<BR><BR>
<A Name="197"></A><B>[197]</B> The Phrase "SO GIVEN.THAT" means "because."<BR><BR>
<A Name="198"></A><B>[198]</B> It is not certain if the word "After" is part of what Paroh said or if it comes before the words of Paroh.<BR><BR>
<A Name="199"></A><B>[199]</B> The phrase "and upon your mouth he will kiss all my people" may also be translated as "and by the words of your mouth will all my people be touched" or "and by your edge (of the sword) will all my people be armed."<BR><BR>
<A Name="200"></A><B>[200]</B> The phrase "!(mp)~make~COME BARLEY FAMINE HOUSE~s~you(mp)" appears to be missing the prefix "to~" before the word "Famine."<BR><BR>
<A Name="201"></A><B>[201]</B> Most translations have "with grain" but the word "with" is not in the Hebrew text. Either this word is missing from the text or the word grain is in the construct state - instruments of grain.<BR><BR>
<A Name="202"></A><B>[202]</B> The Hebrew word for "lord" is written in the plural, possibly in reference to the great power (often emphasized by plurality) that Yoseph holds. Also in verse 33.<BR><BR>
<A Name="203"></A><B>[203]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT UNLESS" means "for if."<BR><BR>
<A Name="204"></A><B>[204]</B> The word "I-did-BE.CHILDLESS" is written twice, probably a scribal error.<BR><BR>
<A Name="205"></A><B>[205]</B> The phrase "and~they(m)~will~GO.DOWN Mits'rayim" should read "and Mits'rayim went down." However, the context implies the sons went down to Mits'rayim therefore, the suffix "unto" or the prefix "to" is missing from the word Mits'rayim which would then read "and they went down unto Mits'rayim."<BR><BR>
<A Name="206"></A><B>[206]</B> The word house appears to be missing the suffix "unto" or the prefix "to" so that it would read "and they were brought down unto the house of Yoseph."<BR><BR>
<A Name="207"></A><B>[207]</B> This word can also mean "matter."<BR><BR>
<A Name="208"></A><B>[208]</B> The phrase "and~to~>~TAKE AT~us to~the~SERVANT~s" can be translated as "and to take us to the servants" or "and take us for servants."<BR><BR>
<A Name="209"></A><B>[209]</B> Qere = &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;.<BR><BR>
<A Name="210"></A><B>[210]</B> The grammar of this phrase can also be translated as "and Elohiym said, he will show you beauty my son."<BR><BR>
<A Name="211"></A><B>[211]</B> The beginning of this verse reads differently in the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia which would be mechanically translated as "and~he~will~LIFT.UP UPRISING~s from~At UPRISING UPRISING~s".<BR><BR>
<A Name="212"></A><B>[212]</B> The three nouns "BAG~s the~MAN~s FOODSTUFF" should grammatically be translated as "the bags of the men of the foodstuff" but, apparently a word, such as "With," is missing before the word "Foodstuff."<BR><BR>
<A Name="213"></A><B>[213]</B> The Phrase "ALSO NOW" means "let it be."<BR><BR>
<A Name="214"></A><B>[214]</B> The phrase "and~he~will~LOAD MAN," would be translated as "and a man loaded" but context dictates that the phrase should read as "and~they(m)~will~ LOAD MAN " which would then be translated as "and each loaded" (compare with 44:11).<BR><BR>
<A Name="215"></A><B>[215]</B> The Phrase "UNTIL TO.THIS.POINT" means "ever again" or "yet."<BR><BR>
<A Name="216"></A><B>[216]</B> The verb "he~will~FLARE.UP" appears to be an error as the context implies that it should be "you(mp)~will~FLARE.UP."<BR><BR>
<A Name="217"></A><B>[217]</B> The prefix "in" appears to be missing before the word "house."<BR><BR>
<A Name="218"></A><B>[218]</B> It is uncertain if the descendant of Dan identified here is named Hhushim (a plural name due to the "im" suffix) or are the descendants of Hhush (plural in number). Because the verse begins with "and the sons" (plural) it would appear that it is the descendants of Hhush but, the total number of children born to Bilhah are seven (see vs. 25) and Hushim would be only one of these.<BR><BR>
<A Name="219"></A><B>[219]</B> An idiom meaning "apart from."<BR><BR>
<A Name="220"></A><B>[220]</B> The Hebrew word translated as "Custom," meaning custom (see vs. 26), may have been miswritten for the word hheleq meaning a portion (see 31:14).<BR><BR>
<A Name="221"></A><B>[221]</B> The Phrase "SHORT LAND" means "short distance."<BR><BR>
<A Name="222"></A><B>[222]</B> Qere = &#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465; .<BR><BR>

<A Name="225"></A><B>[225]</B> The Phrase "GIVEN.THAT SO" means "since."<BR><BR>
<A Name="226"></A><B>[226]</B> The first verse of the book of Exodus begins with "and," indicating that this is a continuation of the final verse of Genesis.<BR><BR>
<A Name="227"></A><B>[227]</B> The Septuagint and the Dead Sea Scrolls have 75.<BR><BR>
<A Name="228"></A><B>[228]</B> The phrase &#1514;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; is grammatically incorrect. the subject of the verb is the word &#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; (Battle), which is a feminine singular noun. However, the verb identifies the subject of the verb as a feminine plural. If the final letters of the verb were originally &#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (meaning "us," the object of the verb) instead of &#1504;&#1464;&#1492; (meaning "she," the subject of the verb), then this would read "a battle will meet us," which makes more contextual and grammatical sense.<BR><BR>
<A Name="229"></A><B>[229]</B> The word "Hand" may be in error and may have originally been "Lip," meaning "edge."<BR><BR>
<A Name="230"></A><B>[230]</B> That is, a "judge," as one who decides.<BR><BR>
<A Name="231"></A><B>[231]</B> That is "shepherds."<BR><BR>
<A Name="232"></A><B>[232]</B> The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488; appears to be missing the prefix "to."<BR><BR>
<A Name="233"></A><B>[233]</B> That is "shepherds."<BR><BR>
<A Name="234"></A><B>[234]</B> The Hebrew word &#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; (qodesh) is translated as "holy," an adjective, in all other translations. While this word can be used as an adjective, it cannot here and in many other occurrences of this word. The reason being, the word &#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; is a masculine word while the word for ground, &#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492; (adamah), is a feminine word and in Hebrew, the adjective and the noun it modifies must match in gender. In addition, the word &#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492; is written as &#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;, indicating the phrase &#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514; &#1511;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; is in the construct state and should be translated as "ground of a special place."<BR><BR>
<A Name="235"></A><B>[235]</B> The Hebrew word &#1510;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501; (their cry) should be written as &#1510;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465; (his cry) as the pronoun is referring to &#1506;&#1463;&#1501; (people), a masculine singular noun. This is also evident in the fact that the pronoun "his" is used with the following words. <BR><BR>
<A Name="236"></A><B>[236]</B> This word can also mean "milk."<BR><BR>
<A Name="237"></A><B>[237]</B> The Hebrew word &#1491;&#1489;&#1513; means a "sticky mass" and can also mean "dates" from the palm tree.<BR><BR>

<A Name="244"></A><B>[244]</B> The first word may be in error and might have originally been the word &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512; (and he said) as the following words are the words of YHWH to Mosheh. Because the first four words of this verse are the same as the next verse, the scribe may have mistakenly used the word &#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492; from the next verse.<BR><BR>
<A Name="245"></A><B>[245]</B> In context, the phrase "hear the voice" means "heed the message."<BR><BR>

<A Name="247"></A><B>[247]</B> The Hebrew text appears to be missing text. The Septuagint, which may preserve the original wording, reads, "please send another by the hand that you can send."<BR><BR>
<A Name="248"></A><B>[248]</B> Mosheh's father-in-law is identified by two different names in this text, &#1497;&#1514;&#1512; (yeter) and &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493; (yitro).<BR><BR>
<A Name="249"></A><B>[249]</B> This word appears to be missing the suffix "unto," the prefix "to" or the word "To."<BR><BR>
<A Name="250"></A><B>[250]</B> The "him" may be Mosheh, but may also be his son (see 4:25).<BR><BR>
<A Name="251"></A><B>[251]</B> The prefix &#1500; appears to be missing from the word &#1492;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;.<BR><BR>

However, the word &#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (man or each, the subject of the verb) is a masculine singular word. therefore, the verb should be written as &#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498; (and he threw out). <BR><BR>

<A Name="528"></A><B>[528]</B> In this verse the "Elohiym" is being identified with a masculine singular pronoun. (Compare with Exodus 32:1, 32:4 and 32:8.)<BR><BR>
<A Name="529"></A><B>[529]</B> The pronoun "him," identifies the word "Elohiym" as a masculine singular noun. In addition, the image representing the "Elohiym" is a single bullock. (Compare with Exodus 32:1, 32:4 and 32:5 and the following Footnote.)<BR><BR>
<A Name="530"></A><B>[530]</B> The word "Elohiym" is identified as a masculine plural noun, as it is modified with the masculine plural pronoun "these." (Compare with the previous Footnote and Exodus 32:1, 32:4 and 32:5.)<BR><BR>
